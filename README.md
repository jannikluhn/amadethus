# Amadethus

Amadethus is a live audification of the Ethereum Blockchain. It uses Mozart's Musical Dice Game to transform the sequence of blocks into a sequence of waltzes. A digital piano plays back the music at roughly the same tempo at which new blocks are produced, resulting in a neverending stream of waltzes.

Mozart's Musical Dice Game published in 1792 is a simple algorithm to compose random waltzes. The player throws two dice and looks up the number in a table of 176 pre-composed measures. They write down the entry on a sheet and repeat the process sixteen times, resulting in a unique waltz everytime the game is played. Amadethus works very similar, but the music is determined by the entropy contained in Ethereum blocks instead of random dice throws.
